Description: Semiparametric distributional regression methods (expectile, quantile and mode regression) for time-to-event variables with right-censoring; uses inverse probability of censoring weights or accelerated failure time models with auxiliary likelihoods. Expectile regression using inverse probability of censoring weights has been introduced in Seipp et al. (2021) "Weighted Expectile Regression for Right-Censored Data" <doi:10.1002/sim.9137>, mode regression for time-to-event variables has been introduced in Seipp et al. (2022) "Flexible Semiparametric Mode Regression for Time-to-Event Data" <doi:10.1177/09622802221122406>.
