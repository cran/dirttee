Description: Semiparametric distributional regression methods (expectile,
    quantile and mode regression) for time-to-event variables with
    right-censoring; uses inverse probability of censoring weights or
    accelerated failure time models with auxiliary likelihoods. Expectile
    regression using inverse probability of censoring weights has been
    introduced in Seipp et al. (2021) ``Weighted Expectile Regression for
    Right-Censored Data'' <doi:10.1002/sim.9137>, mode regression for
    time-to-event variables has been introduced in Seipp et al. (2022)
    ``Flexible Semiparametric Mode Regression for Time-to-Event Data''
    <doi:10.1177/09622802221122406>.
